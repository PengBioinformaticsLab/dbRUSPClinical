## About dbRUSPClinical

dbRUSPClinical is an interactive database to show the correlation of clinical variables of screen-negative newborns. It currently contains the clinical variables from about half a million babies reported by a public NBS program. Using dbRUSP, users can explore the association between these clinical variables under different conditions. For example, the correlation between birth weight and gestational age in different ethnicity groups. 

## Data

Data from 500,539 screen-negative singleton babies born between 2013 and 2017 were selected at random by the California NBS program. Some samples with extreme values of the clinical variables were removed from the database. There are eight clinical variables included in this database: age at blood collection, birth weight, gestational age, sex, total parental nutrition, ethnicity, blood transfusion, and maternal age. We categorized a few continuous variables to show their correlations more clearly.

dbRUSP was built using the R shiny package and the source code is publicly available at GitHub. You may also be interested to explore our related projects and web-based tools under https://rusptools.shinyapps.io/home/.

Response time for some queries may be delayed (30-60 sec) due to large sample size. Processing time and encountered latencies may depend on the speed and quality of the servers and internet connection.
